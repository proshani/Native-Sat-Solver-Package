Run

```shell
source ./eval.sh
```

This will automatically compile your code and test your code with sample cases. If there's no output, you've prefectly passed all the sample cases. Otherwise, the difference will be printed.

Your excutable file and output should be `pa1` and `/test/test_yours.out` respectively. You can also check your answer with standard output `/test/test.out` manually.

### Add your test cases

We only provide few test cases. So, it's important for you to add your own test cases and make your code robust enough.

Add your input and sample output in `test/test.in` and `test/test.out`. Each line is a test case.
